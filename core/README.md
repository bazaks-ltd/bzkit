### Mobile

For the mobile application we will be using Nativescript https://nativescript.org/ but vue3
which is still in beta

```
ns create mobile --template @nativescript-vue/template-blank@beta

cd mobile
ns run ios|android
```

This template already has tailwind css https://tailwindcss.com/ included inside of it so no need to install it.
